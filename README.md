# Stats API

Little stats counters for [my about page](https://lowmess.com/about)

### App secrets

This pad contains some secret keys which you will need to provide as environment variables. Use `dotenv` to do that in development, and `now` secrets to do it in production.

Here's the keys you need:

- `ENGINE_API_KEY` - Apollo Engine API key (optional)
- `GITHUB_KEY` - GitHub personal access token
- `GITHUB_ID` - GitHub user ID to find commits for
- `LASTFM_KEY` - Last.fm oauth token
- `LASTFM_USERNAME` - Last.fm username to look up
- `FITBIT_KEY` - Fitbit oauth token
- `GOODREADS_KEY` - Goodreads API key
- `GOODREADS_ID` - Goodreads user id to look up
- `FOURSQUARE_KEY` - Foursquare oauth token
